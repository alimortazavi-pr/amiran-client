        At Amiran, we firmly believe that Health, Safety, and Environmental
        protection are not just legal obligations—they are a fundamental part of
        our culture, our ethics, and our responsibility toward our people, our
        clients, and the environment we operate in. Our HSE policy is built
        around a proactive and preventive approach. From the very first stages
        of planning a project to the final phases of execution and delivery,
        safety is integrated into every process and decision. We continuously
        assess risks, implement global best practices, and update safety
        measures to ensure the well-being of every worker, visitor, and
        stakeholder on-site. We ensure that all personnel are properly trained,
        certified, and fully aware of the safety protocols specific to their
        role and working environment. Use of personal protective equipment
        (PPE), compliance with hazard warnings, and strict adherence to safety
        guidelines are mandatory and non-negotiable. In addition to occupational
        safety, we are deeply committed to environmental sustainability. We take
        deliberate steps to minimize environmental impact by reducing waste,
        managing energy consumption, recycling materials, and protecting local
        ecosystems throughout our operations. By embedding safety, health, and
        environmental values into the heart of our work, we strive not only to
        complete projects successfully—but to do so in a way that respects
        people, protects nature, and builds a better future for the next
        generations. We believe that every incident is preventable, every life
        is valuable, and every decision matters. Safety is not a slogan for
        us—it is our way of building.
